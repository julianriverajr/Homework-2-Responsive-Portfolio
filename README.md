# Mobile-First Responsive-Portfolio

## Objective

I have created a website with a responsive navigation bar, a responsive layout, and responsive images; that is, they have to adjust to different screen sizes. This website serves as my personal site, with an "about me" section, a "portfolio" section showing my best work, and a "contact" section in which folks can choose how they want to get in contact with me.
